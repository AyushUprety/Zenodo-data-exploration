# Fitness Tracker Data Exploration

**Project Overview:** This project delves into the exploration of Fitbit fitness tracker data. From 18 available CSV files, the focus is narrowed down to 4 core datasets that contain key information about user activities, such as step count, calorie burn, and sleep minutes. The goal is to uncover trends and insights related to user health, behavior, and smart device usage, which can help health tech companies enhance their products and services. The analysis is divided into 4 phases, with each step and result documented in a markdown report.

**Tools Used:** RStudio and R Markdown.

**Key Skills Applied:** 
- Data importing and examination
- Data cleaning (e.g., handling duplicates, reformatting columns)
- Merging datasets
- Descriptive statistics
- Aggregating and transforming data
- Data visualization and reporting

**Deliverables:**
- A `.md` report detailing the project workflow, processes, insights, visualizations, and conclusions.
